# Mathematical Statistics Laboratories - Mathematics Specialization
This repository contains the laboratories for the Mathematical Statistics course, part of the Mathematics Specialization at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, Babe»ô-Bolyai University (UBB). The labs are implemented using MATLAB.

The repository includes various exercises and problem-solving approaches related to statistical theory and its applications. Each lab focuses on concepts such as probability distributions, estimation, hypothesis testing, and statistical inference, all explored through computational methods.

Feel free to explore the code, make improvements, or contribute!
